  <p> Hello! This is my self portrait. I will be a senior in the fall 2023 at UMW. My major is <span class ="highlight">Communications and Digital Studies and I am minoring in Journalism.</span> Home for me is the Northern Neck and I've been a fan of being on the water almost my whole life. Sailing is a hobby for me and I enjoy it both casually and competitively. Outside of that, I would say my other hobbies would be more around video-games. My recent usage on the computer is about atleast <span class ="highlight">6+ hours a day.</span> My screen time for my phone is currently <span class ="highlight">3 hours and 27 minutes</span> which has been the general average for quite some time. This is mainly due ot me using my computer much more often than my phone. The only usage for my phone is communciating and waking up or falling asleep bored.
    <!-- When I was creating this self-portrait, I really wanted to incorporate something that was important to me and I enjoy. In doing so, I decided to choose sailing and the best way I could illustrate that was by inserting an image of me sailing back in highschool with a friend. I wanted a clean styled theme with borders surrounding the important text and titles and I completed that with a little help from Google in relation to looking at how to insert images appropriately as well as moving them into the right locations. Something I'm still not exactly sure about though is whether or not my Github page is displaying my local file correctly. For me the image isn't there so I will just attach a Gyazo file in this comment section to show what I am seeing: https://gyazo.com/80a06e3233d3244e9a52ac4105e84d85 -->
