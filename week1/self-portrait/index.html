  <p> Hello! This is my self portrait. I will be a senior in the fall 2023 at UMW. My major is <span class ="highlight">Communications and Digital Studies and I am minoring in Journalism.</span> Home for me is the Northern Neck and I've been a fan of being on the water almost my whole life. Sailing is a hobby for me and I enjoy it both casually and competitively. Outside of that, I would say my other hobbies would be more around video-games. My recent usage on the computer is about atleast <span class ="highlight">6+ hours a day.</span> My screen time for my phone is currently <span class ="highlight">3 hours and 27 minutes</span> which has been the general average for quite some time. This is mainly due ot me using my computer much more often than my phone. The only usage for my phone is communciating and waking up or falling asleep bored.
